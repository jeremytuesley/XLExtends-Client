A full stack developer needs to be able to demonstrate they can build a complete application from design through to deployment for a commercial client (using appropriate tools and methodologies).

You are to design a web application (app) built for a real world customer.

Find a business or organisation (preferably near Coder Academy) to build an app for.

Meet with the business owner or organisation manager to find out what challenges they face. Find a problem that you can solve with an app and present your ideas to the client.

The project must be completed in the assigned groups.
